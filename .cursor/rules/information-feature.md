## Goals

1. Increase interactivity and usefulness of the app.
2. Create wonderful visuals.


## Feature

1. Upon hovering result cards, cursor should be pointer, and a highlighted caret should show at the right center of the card.
2. On click a card, the result list should smoothly move to the left of the screen. All cards apart from the selected one should dim in brightness. The list should become scrollable, filling the screen top to bottom.
3. An image of the selected celestial body should fill the entire background.
4. Text information should pop up on the space created at the right. The text should contain real, scientifically verified data about the celestial body. **Fake data and information is NOT allowed**. The text info should contain interesting facts about the object, along with basic information, as size, distance, etc. Basic information should always be at the top on a separate layout.
5. Hovering the not selected results from the list should brighten up the hovered card, clearer than the others but still dimmer than the currently selected. Clocking it should update the image and information on screen to the newly selected one, along with the list state.
6. An "X" button should show at the top right of the screen. Clicking it reverts the state of the app back to the results list.


## Requirements

1. Every interaction and element introduction must be smoothly animated.
2. Layouts must remain consistent through differently selected celestial bodies.
